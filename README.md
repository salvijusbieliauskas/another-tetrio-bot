# another-tetrio-bot
A simple pixel-scanning bot for the game TETR.IO built with **.NET Framework v4.7.2**.

## Features

- Fine-tuning game state evaluation model weights using a genetic algorithm that
- Offline play simulation used for testing and training
- Interfacing with the TETR.IO game window in order to read upcoming pieces and send keystrokes

## Considerations

Using macros, bots and other kinds of automation software is against the TETR.IO Terms of Service, therefore this
software must only be used with a valid TETR.IO bot account.

This is a personal project made with the intent to learn more about algorithms and their application, the code contains
lots of *magic numbers*, boilerplate and will certainly require editing and configuration to work. If you're looking for
a well-made or interesting TETR.IO bot, look [elsewhere](https://github.com/ZetrisAI/Zetris).
